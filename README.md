# HashCheck
*An easy to use crypthographic hash checker for your terminal*  
  
I created this python script to allow you to verify your files when you need it. It is fast and easy to use.

### ⚠ Note: this is my first git project and my first kind of useful program, expect unprofessionalism from me. Sorry. ⚠

### How to use it?
- First, launch the script by typing `python3 AlgCheck.py`
- Then it will ask you the hash of the file, simply just type/paste it there.
- Then you can select between the algorithms to verify your files with, they are, I just use `sha256` for most of the time.
- Last, but not least, it will ask for the location of the file. Simply just copy the path and **filename** plus **extension** into the terminal.
- Now you should wait until the process is finished and gives you the correct output if the hash matches the file hash or not.
